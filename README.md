# 🏡 Home Automation Lab

Welcome to my smart home lab, powered by Home Assistant, ESP32 devices, and Apple HomeKit. This repo documents my setups, automations, dashboards, and all the chaos I've tamed along the way.

## 🔌 Core Setup
- **Router**: Xfinity XB8 (2.4/5GHz split)
- **Hub**: Raspberry Pi 4 running Home Assistant OS
- **Smart Hub**: Apple TV (HomeKit)
- **Devices**: Smart plugs, lights, ESPHome sensors

## 📁 Structure
- `automations/`: YAML files for my automations
- `esphome/`: Configs for ESP32-based devices
- `dashboards/`: Lovelace or wall tablet views
- `homekit-bridge/`: What I expose to Apple Home + bridge setup notes
- `notes/`: Troubleshooting, fixes, and guides
- `backups/`: Archived configs and snapshots

## 📓 Goals
- Maintain a clean, stable, and fast smart home
- Fully local automations with Home Assistant
- Reconnect faster when Wi-Fi or devices break
